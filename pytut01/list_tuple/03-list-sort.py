# to sort the companies list by revenue from highest to lowest.
# First, specify a sort key and pass it to the sort() method. 
# To define a sort key, you create a function that accepts a tuple and returns the element 
# that you want to sort by, in below case, third element:
def sort_key(company):
    return company[2]

# Second, pass the sort_key function to the sort() method:
companies.sort(key=sort_key, reverse=True)

# The sort() method will use the value returned by the sort_key() function for the comparisons.

# Using lambda expression
# To make it more concise, Python allows you to define a function without a name with the following syntax:
# lambda arguments: expression
# A function without a name is called an anonymous function. And this syntax is called a lambda expression.
# Technically, itâ€™s equivalent to the following function:
# def name(arguments):
#     return expression
companies.sort(key=lambda company: company[2], reverse=True)
