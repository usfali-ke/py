# Python has a built-in function called filter() that allows you to filter a list (or a tuple) in a more beautiful way.
# filter(fn, list)
# The filter() function iterates over the elements of the list and applies the fn() function to each element. It returns an iterator for the elements where the fn() returns True.
# In fact, you can pass any iterable to the second argument of the filter() function, not just a list.

filtered2 = filter(lambda score: score > 80, scores)
print(list(filtered2))

# Since the filter() function returns an iterator, you can use a for loop to iterate over it. 
# Or you can use the list() function to convert the iterator to a list.

# Python reduce() function to reduce a list into a single value.
scores = [75, 65, 80, 95, 50]

# to calculate the sum of all elements in the scores list, you can use a for loop like this:
total = 0
for score in scores:

print(total)

# In above example, we have reduced the whole list into a single value, which is the sum of all elements from the list.

# Python offers a function called reduce() that allows you to reduce a list in a more concise way.
# reduce(fn,list)
# the reduce() isnâ€™t a built-in function in Python. In fact, the reduce() function belongs to the functools module.
# The reduce() function applies the fn function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of the list, from left to right, 
# to reduce the list into a single value.

# To make the code more concise, you can use a lambda expression instead of defining the sum() function:
